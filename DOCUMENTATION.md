## Introduction

This application is a comprehensive personal wellness and productivity platform. It aims to help users build mindful routines, track habits, manage tasks, and integrate with fitness services. The platform is designed as an all-in-one solution for personal development, focusing on four key areas:

1.  **Mindfulness & Reflection**: Features a morning ritual with gratitude practice, intention setting, and journaling.
2.  **Task Management**: Offers smart task organization, including energy-based scheduling and a Pomodoro timer.
3.  **Health & Fitness**: Includes nutrition tracking, weight monitoring, and integration with Strava for workout activities.
4.  **Goal Setting**: Provides tools for tracking long-term goals and conducting weekly reflections.

## Features

Based on the current application structure (`src/App.tsx`), the **Task Management** capabilities are the primary active features. Other features described in the project's README exist within the codebase but are not currently integrated into the main application flow.

### Task Management (Primary Active Feature)

  is_active: boolean
  created_at: Timestamp
  updated_at: Timestamp
  user_id: UUID (Foreign Key â†’ profiles.id)
}
```

#### 3. Tasks (`tasks`)

}
```

#### 4. Pomodoro Sessions (`pomodoro_sessions`)
Tracks work sessions for tasks using the Pomodoro technique.
```typescript
{
  id: UUID (Primary Key)
  duration_minutes: number
  start_time: Timestamp
  end_time: Timestamp
  completed: boolean
  task_id: UUID (Foreign Key â†’ tasks.id)

  updated_at: Timestamp
  user_id: UUID (Foreign Key â†’ profiles.id)
}
```

### Table Relationships

#### User-Centric Structure
-   All tables (except `pomodoro_distractions`) have a direct `user_id` reference to `profiles`.
-   This ensures data isolation between users.
-   Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce this relationship.

#### Task Management Flow
1.  Users create projects.
2.  Tasks are created within projects (optional).
3.  Tasks can be worked on using Pomodoro sessions.
4.  Pomodoro sessions can have distractions logged.

#### Optional Planning Features
1.  Calendar entries can be used to schedule tasks.
2.  Quarterly goals provide long-term planning.
3.  Weekly intentions help with weekly planning and reflection.

### Data Flow Examples

#### Creating a Task
1.  User creates a project (optional).
2.  User creates a task, optionally linking it to a project.
3.  Task can be scheduled in calendar entries.

#### Working on a Task
1.  User starts a Pomodoro session for a task.
2.  During the session, distractions can be logged.
3.  Session completion is recorded.
4.  Task completion can be updated.

#### Planning Work
1.  User sets quarterly goals.
2.  User plans weekly intentions.
3.  User schedules tasks in calendar.
4.  User organizes tasks into projects.

### Security
-   Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all tables.
-   Users can only access their own data.
-   Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity.
-   Cascading deletes are implemented where appropriate.

### Performance
-   Indexes are created on frequently queried columns.
-   Foreign key relationships are indexed.
-   Timestamp fields are indexed for efficient date-based queries.

## Usage

The application's primary active feature is Task Management. Here's how to use its main functionalities:

1.  **Authentication**:
    -   Navigate to the `/auth` page to log in or create a new account.
    -   Alternatively, the `/landing` page will direct you to authentication if you try to access the app without being logged in.

2.  **Accessing Task Management**:
    -   Once logged in, you will be directed to the main Tasks page (`/`).

3.  **Creating a Task**:
    -   Look for an "Add Task" or similar button/input field on the Tasks page.
    -   Enter the task title, description, due date (if applicable), and assign an energy level.
    -   You may also be able to assign the task to a project.

4.  **Managing Tasks**:
    -   View your tasks in the task list.
    -   Mark tasks as complete.
    -   Filter tasks (e.g., by energy level or project).
    -   Prioritize tasks as needed.

5.  **Using the Pomodoro Timer**:
    -   Locate the Pomodoro timer controls (often represented by a tomato icon or a timer display).
    -   Start the timer for a focused work session on a specific task.
    -   The timer will typically run for a set period (e.g., 25 minutes), followed by a short break.
    -   Some visual cues, like a screen blur (`PomodoroBlurOverlay`) or a persistent timer in the tab bar (`TabBarTimer`), might be active.

6.  **AI-Powered Features**:
    -   **Task Intelligence**: When creating tasks, the AI might automatically suggest categories, priorities, or energy levels based on the task description.
    -   **Weekly Task Reflection**: The system may provide insights into your task completion patterns and productivity.

(Note: Since other features like Journaling, Goals, Nutrition, etc., are not actively routed in the application, usage instructions for them are omitted here. If these features become active, this section should be updated.)
